## How to nominate yourself

1. Familiarise yourself with the [Nix Community Values](https://github.com/NixOS/nix-constitutional-assembly/blob/main/values.md) and the [Nix Governance Constitution](https://github.com/NixOS/nix-constitutional-assembly/blob/main/constitution.md).
   If you become an SC member, you will need to uphold these.
   If you have any questions about these documents, feel free to [contact the EC](../README.md#election-committee-ec).
1. Ensure that you're in the [@NixOS/voters-2024 team](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/voters-2024)
   and otherwise [request a voter exception](./exception-request.md).
1. Ensure that your [email is correct](./email.md) and
   create a PR to add an *empty* `candidates/<github handle>.md` file matching your GitHub handle.
   This is easiest [directly on GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/new/main?filename=candidates/%3Cgithub%20handle%3E.md).
   The PR title must contain your GitHub handle and PR description should be left empty.
1. You will receive an email asking you to send back the filled-out [candidate template](../doc/candidate-template.md).
   You can submit (and update) this form [until Tuesday 2024-10-01](../README.md#timeline).
   If you become a candidate, this form will be published and linked on the ballot.
1. [Until Tuesday 2024-10-01](../README.md#timeline),
   find at least 3 other people in the [@NixOS/voters-2024 team](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/voters-2024) to [endorse](./endorse.md) you,
   such that among you and the endorsers,
   there are at least four people with no two sharing a [conflict of interest](./conflict-of-interest.md).
