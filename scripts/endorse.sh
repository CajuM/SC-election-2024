Hello, @$ENDORSER_LOGIN

You've indicated that you'd like to endorse a nominee for the Nix Steering Committee.

To complete the endorsement,
reply to this email with a disclosure of _all_ your potential sources of conflicts of interest.
This includes, but is not limited to, employers or otherwise payers of Nix work.

We will use this disclosure to check for conflicts of interest with
any candidates you endorse but also their other endorsers.
As such, you will only receive this request once for this election.

Note that this disclosure will not be published.
