### Conflict of interest disclosure

I don't have conflict of interest as of today, as I work with
Nix/Nixpkgs/NixOS only on private projects, and on my personal laptop.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I feel that our community has great values and motivations, and very
competent community members, but I feel that our priorities are not
ordered properly, and the priorities themselves could be better
communicated.

#### What I have done

You can see my PRs involvement in this link:

https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=involves%3Adoronbehar

I think what stands out with me is fast, and accurate communication
skills. Another thing I do which I see almost nobody else doing, related
to communication is giving timeout for people to respond to changes. A
good example of this kind of behavior of mine is available here:

https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/225051#pullrequestreview-2231484654

#### What I'll do

I'd like to encourage better communication habits in the community, and
encourage the community to adopt policies regarding non-communicative
community members, and thus to help lower the amount of stale PRs.

In addition, I'd like to steer the community's efforts to prioritize:

- Improve documentation text, that also communicates current, on-going,
  WIP processes (see these comments on discourse:
   * https://discourse.nixos.org/t/documenting-bugs-and-interfaces-worth-improving-in-nixpkgs-and-nixos/30884
   * https://discourse.nixos.org/t/several-comments-about-priorities-and-new-policies-in-the-python-ecosystem/51790/13?u=doronbehar
- Structured documentation: It is very unfortunate how [this
  effort](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/108063) gets no
  attention now... I view the situation of our documentation is
  another lack of communication, which I want to improve further.
