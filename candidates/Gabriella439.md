### Conflict of interest disclosure

I am a principal engineer at [Mercury Technologies](https://mercury.com/blog/category/engineering), a company that uses Nix and NixOS extensively. I also am the author of the [NixOS in Production](https://leanpub.com/nixos-in-production) book.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I've been a longtime contributor, educator, and evangelist for the Nix community because I adore Nix to death and want to see Nix succeed.  I'm running for election because I have prior project leadership experience as the creator of [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/) that informs my views on project management and community governance.

#### What I have done

My headline contributions to the Nix ecosystem are:

- I authored the [NixOS in Production](https://leanpub.com/nixos-in-production) book

  This is a work-in-progress book I have been working to promote industry use of NixOS.  The book is both free as in beer (the minimum purchase price is $0.00) and free as in freedom (the [source material is publicly available](https://github.com/Gabriella439/nixos-in-production?tab=readme-ov-file#nixos-in-production) under a Creative Commons license).

- I created [`nix-serve-ng`](https://github.com/aristanetworks/nix-serve-ng)

  This is a drop-in replacement for `nix-serve` that I created and open sourced from my previous job which is not only more stable but also *significantly* more efficient than all of the alternatives.

- I created [`terraform-nixos-ng`](https://github.com/Gabriella439/terraform-nixos-ng)

  Anyone who has done professional NixOS deployments knows that the conventional wisdom is to use Terraform instead of NixOps.  However, the `terraform-nixos` repository went abandoned several years ago and I created a maintained successor project.

- I added [`darwin.linux-builder`](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/unstable/#sec-darwin-builder) to Nixpkgs

  This lets you run NixOS tests on macOS.  I did not build this singlehandedly, though, and built upon prior work to create a polished user interface.

I also have a decade of professional Nix experience.  I was the person who successfully introduced the use of Nix and NixOS at my previous job (Awake Security, acquired by Arista Networks) and I'm currently a principal engineer at Mercury (also a Nix/NixOS company and I'm the lead for all things Nix-related there).

â€¦ and those are just my Nix-related accomplishments!

Outside of Nix, I'm also the author of the [Haskell for all](https://www.haskellforall.com/) blog and the [Dhall configuration language](https://dhall-lang.org/), and I contributed a large number of open source projects, blog posts, and presentations for both the Haskell and Dhall ecosystems.  One of the most notable examples is my presentation on [How to market Haskell to mainstream programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNpsgTIpODA) where I explain how an open source ecosystem can gain mainstream adoption and traction.  I have been living and breathing tech evangelism for over a decade.

Moreover, I have direct experience with community management and language evolution.  In particular, for the Dhall ecosystem I set up all of the community infrastructure, set up community self-governance, the funding process, and also created [the language standard and standard evolution process](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to promote the stable growth and evolution of the language ecosystem and the surrounding community.

#### What I'll do

My main goals are:

- [Focus on NixOS as the path to mainstream adoption](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/50#issuecomment-2379364129)

  Specifically, the community should build out a polished user experience for deploying and maintaining NixOS as a server OS.

- [Create a diverse, inclusive, and welcoming community](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/7#issuecomment-2378611472)

  I want the Nix community to be a safe haven for vulnerable minorities, including racial minorities and gender minorities.

- [Prohibit unethical or morally grey industries from promoting themselves using the NixOS trademark](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/17#issuecomment-2378125851)
  
  The intention is to forbid these industries from using the NixOS trademark in promotional materials (e.g. for recruitment or their engineering blog) and to prevent meetups or conferences that use the NixOS trademark from endorsing or accepting sponsorships from these industries.  These industries would still be allowed to contribute to the ecosystem and employees in these industries would still be allowed to participate in community spaces.

- [Change the Nix Steering Committee elections to use approval voting instead of CIVS](https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/35#issuecomment-2377831158)
  
  This is a smaller thing, but I still think it's important.
