# Conflict of interest disclosure

* I am part of the numtide.com team.
* I did paid work on nixpkgs for personalkollen.se and niteo.co.
* I had a NGI grant from NLNet to work on dream2nix python support.

# Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

As the Nix community continues to grow rapidly, we collectively failed to scale our decision-making and community management structures in time. While this culminated in open letters, flame wars & resignations earlier this year, it also raised the bar for new users and contributors long before that, by making it harder to understand how things work and what "best practices" are.

It made me happy to see how many people were able to channel the stress & emotions from those conflicts into the NCA process and its mostly constructive, thought-through debates. I believe the establishment of a SC as a managing, guiding & supervising body for more focused teams is a great step forward and would love to contribute to unblocking some of our long-standing issues if elected.

## Where I come from

Some facts about my background & experiences, so you can get an idea about where my perspectives come from:

* Besides nixpkgs, you might have seen me around dream2nix, disko, nixos-anywhere or other community projects. Or even in person on e.g. NixCon, FOSDEM, CCCamp or OceanSprint. :wave:
* Was part of the short-lived nixpkgs-architecture team, which IMO dissolved mostly due to lack of resources and a somewhat imprecise problem statement but was still a valuable experience.
* Co-founded the nixos.at user group. Was involved in my local hackspace and other community spaces, where I learned a lot about ad-hoc organization, social dynamics in heterogeneous groups and conflict resolution.
* Worked in quite a few different environments: As a sysadmin/SRE with bare-metal at a local community radio and at a small payment provider; As a (mostly python) programmer in an enterprise environment; and as all-of-that-in-one-role at a startup and in managed hosting; I work as a freelancer nowadays.
* Linux user since I was a teenager, ~20 years ago, found nix ~5 years ago, but only started using NixOS and contributing a bit over 3 years ago.

## What I'd like to do

I see this as a team sport, so rather then going in with my personal list of issues first, I would like to gather some low-hanging fruits first to verify the process and get some routine in working together.


* The first task would be to get to know the other members of the SC and board and ensure an understanding of each others background,  priorities and availability to get everyone on the same page and  create an efficent and welcoming work environment.

* The second task would be to interview existing teams to learn about their respective perspectives, issues and blockers and what kind of support they want.

* With that info, identify the most important/urgent decisions to be made and prepare a summary of pros and cons before calling the vote. Do not only document the "what?" of a decision, but also the "who?", "when?", "why?" and possibly a statement by dissenters if the vote was not unanimous.

 That being said, there are a few things I would like to see, advocate for and help where I can. From the top of my head and without claim to completeness:


* Restart https://weekly.nixos.org/ - or make it monthly; 12 newsletters per year are already on the marketing teams agenda. Ideally, depending on resources, we get to regular newsletter with editorialized content. Including, but not limited to: new nix features, significant nixpkgs PRs, links to significant debates on discourse, etc.
As the community grows, it becomes more and more time-consuming to stay up to date with all relevant developments. There's also different sub-communities, emerging around different interests and communication channels. This is a largely a good thing IMO, but I believe an official overview on what's happening would help communications inside and outside the community.

* Assemble a darwin team for nixpkgs and raise funds for it. There's
currently a shortage of darwin builders which slows down CI for nixpkgs PRs. I believe its worth an investment to keep darwin a well-supported platform. For individual users of that platform, but also to easy adoptions in company environments where at least some developers might be on macOS.

* Keep working on the ongoing automation efforts around unified formatting and things like nixpkgs-vet in order to quickly reduce some of the churn in PR reviews. Let's figure out what it would need for merge trains in nixpkgs if feasible.

* Enable flakes by default; get ~consensus on the blockers and solve them or live with them. Whether we like it or not, flakes are widely used in practice and should be stabilized - or deprecated if needed, but the experiment should not last another year. This would also mean to include flakes and new-style CLI commands in official docs.

Hoping this gives you a good picture about my ideas and priorities. Tried to keep it exemplary and short, and will answer the rest in the questions to candidates.

Let me finish with a more personal note: I got into Nix and NixOS when I was all but done with (enterprise) Linux, Kubernetes and maybe computers in general :sweat_smile:.
The sheer creativity and depth of knowledge in this community together with the unmatched customizability of NixOS helped me to find joy in hacking again :two_hearts:
I sincerely hope we can keep fostering those while we grow as a community, both in quantity and in quality!
