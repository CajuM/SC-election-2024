### Conflict of interest disclosure

I have no conflict of interest to disclose. I'm not paid for anything related to Nix.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I have encountered many difficulties and issues while using and contributing to NixOS. I hope to help resolve these problems and lower the barriers to using NixOS, especially for users in mainland China.

#### What I have done

I maintain dozens of packages and modules in nixpkgs.

#### What I'll do

I will consider Chinese users when making decisions about changes to NixOS infrastructure, aiming to make it as easy as possible for them to use NixOS.
