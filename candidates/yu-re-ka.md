### Conflict of interest disclosure

I am currently part-time employed by Wolfsburger Dienstleistungs- und Meldezentrale GmbH.

I have been paid within the last year by FLOKLI OÃœ for freelance work on Tvix.

I have received two cryptocurrency 'airdrops' which other long-time nixpkgs contributers have received as well.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

My activity in the Nix community goes back to 2018, when I moved my personal computers to NixOS and started packaging software and writing modules. Later on, I worked on scalability problems, namely being unable to package new software which uses a yarn.lock file to describe its dependencies, since adding the generated yarn.nix code into nixpkgs would bloat the nixpkgs repo too much, leading to the inception of the FOD-fetcher fetchYarnDeps.
I maintained the GitLab module and package until beginning of this year. I packaged Electron from source, meaning that nixpkgs and its users can apply patches to the source code, making bug hunting and supporting new platforms easier.

#### What I'll do

I want to reduce the long-term infrastructure cost, as well as the human / burn-out cost of maintaining such a project. My actions will be guided by the Nix Community Values, the hacker ethic[1] and the love for free software. I'll do my best to promote a sustainable path forward, both in technical and social issues, to ensure we can keep hacking together.
