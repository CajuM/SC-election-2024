### Conflict of Interest Disclosure

We use Nix heavily for our team's build and CI system at Viasat. Viasat is a medium-sized Carlsbad ISP with both commercial and defense projects.
 
### What I've done:

- 146 commits to nixpkgs
- [androidenv rewrite](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/89775), [nixPKCS](https://github.com/numinit/nixpkcs), handful of modules including Nebula and Mattermost

### What I'll do

Help advance the project in a stable and transparent way and restore contributor trust. My particular interest is using Nix to improve supply chain security, so that will likely be the focus of projects I look at. This includes things like prototyping options for more trustworthy infra (improving package signing especially), but also keeping communication open between the community and SC.

From a community standpoint, I think the SC should be a united front looking out for and trying to transparently improve pain points, especially in terms of preventing the negative pieces of what happened earlier this year from happening ever again. To that end, I'd like the team's enforcement of moderation rules to be fair, based on behavior and track record. I'd especially like the community to remain on topic and be a vibrant place to talk about technology, and think we can get there if we try a little.
