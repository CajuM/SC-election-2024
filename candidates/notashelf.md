### Conflict of interest disclosure

I hereby disclose that I have sources of conflict of interest.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I have chosen to apply for the Steering Committee following my nomination by a fellow community member, as I am eager 
to take an active role in helping govern the official projects of the Nix community, of which I am a passionate and 
engaged member. I believe my skills and experiences as a programmer, combined with my background in political science, 
align well with the committee's responsibilities of guiding our initiatives and fostering a collaborative environment 
for all.

My most significant involvement has been in unofficial Nix communities—primarily on Discord—where I and many other 
members, including maintainers, committers, and users, have found valuable opportunities to exchange knowledge, 
experiences, opinions, and voices. This ongoing communication has given me insight into the community's pulse and a 
solid understanding of its needs and desires. Although my contributions in an official capacity have been limited so 
far, I am eager to take on more responsibilities and engage constructively with the community. I aim to elevate the 
often-silent voices from the community's many fragments to a more widely accessible platform.

While the concept of an election steering committee within an open-source community is new to me, I intend first to 
observe the status quo and then take action as needed. My goal is to remain aligned with the Nix community values and 
the Nix Governance Constitution while ensuring the legitimacy of the elections. I also aim to bring together the 
currently scattered segments of the community, fostering diverse cultures and modes of communication across various 
social spaces, including Discord and Matrix. It is important to me that every section of the community, regardless of 
experience or engagement level, remains connected.

I am particularly interested in leveraging my involvement in unofficial communities to better understand the needs that 
often go unheard by those actively implementing changes. My aim is to integrate dedicated members into the overall 
process of progress. Additionally, I will apply both technical and non-technical knowledge of Nix to assist with any 
changes as we move forward. I believe this makes me a valuable addition to the Steering Committee.
