### Conflict of interest disclosure

No conflicts.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I am deeply invested in Nix and as a result interested in long term prosperity and sustainability of the Nix community.

#### What I have done

- I have been a long time maintainer of GNOME desktop environment and freedesktop.org affiliated packages.
- I have promoted best practices both in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/jtojnar/nixpkgs-hammering/tree/main/explanations) and upstream (e.g. [CMake](https://github.com/jtojnar/cmake-snips)).
- I have helped people with Nix ecosystem, on [Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/jtojnar/summary), Matrix and [GitHub](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+commenter%3Ajtojnar).
- I implemented [maintainer teams](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/72125) as Nixpkgs concept.
- I currently serve as a member of interim [Nixpkgs committer delegation team](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/nixpkgs-committers.md).
- I served as a shepherd of rejected [RFC 64](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/64).
- Previously, I unsuccessfully candidated for [NixOS constitutional assembly](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/436732-Constitutional-assembly-applications/topic/Jan.20Tojnar.20.2F.20jtojnar/near/438241552)


#### What I'll do

- I want to ensure moderation team has a clear mandate to act when necessary. I want the community to be comfortable for everyone, not just pachyderms who can drag through shards of china on the floor or shallow tar pits.
- I will work on documenting established project-wide customs and practices, and curate new ones. I believe that standardization and unification can reduce hurdles when contributing across components.
- I will support automation for processes that are automatable.
- I plan to set up mentoring for new committers to help guide them into the role.
