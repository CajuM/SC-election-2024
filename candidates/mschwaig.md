### Conflict of interest disclosure

I work for Johannes Kepler University Linz, in Austria.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

I have based the research for my in-progress PhD on Nix,
spent a lot of time trying to understand its security properties,
and finally published my first scientific paper about that.

#### What I'll do

On technical topics

I will support decisions that make Nix a more user-friendly and secure tool.
* The intended user experience should be clear and guided, instead of showering users with information and choices.
* Official documentation and installer should use Flakes and the new CLI, even while they remain unstable.

Take a look at my paper for the technical direction I am in favor of:

On collaboration and social issues

I will protect and support actions to include minorities.
This includes providing reasonably safe official spaces for most of the community to interact, but not overreaching.
For example:
1. Official spaces should not accommodate problematic behavior, because that would be overreach, but
2. unofficial spaces may choose to give groups with different sensibilities somewhere else to go, which is a good thing, since trying to moderate every space the same way would be overreach as well.
3. Contributors who are banned should not lose their ability to vote in an election.
4. No military sponsorships, but respectful treatment of community members' personal choices, like working for a military contractor.
