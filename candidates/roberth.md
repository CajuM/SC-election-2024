### Conflict of interest disclosure

- I fully own [Hercules CI](https://hercules-ci.com), so no venture capitalists are involved in decision making.
  - Hercules CI is a continuous integration and delivery service tailored for small software businesses. It is a small operation with no intention or ability to control a free and independent community like that around Nix.
- I consult for Procolix on the Fediversity project.
  - A fully open source initiative aimed at making Nix-based hosting of fediverse projects more accessible and production-ready. Their leadership prioritizes not only their own open source but supporting their upstream and fostering a healthy ecosystem of open source software and service providers, to ensure the fediverse's long-term success.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I was surprised to see a number of endorsements without detailed platforms, which motivates me to step up and honor the trust people have placed in me.

#### What I have done

My first contribution was in 2016, #17618. I've done a bit of packaging, but most of my efforts can be characterized as programming tasks instead of packaging.
Many of my efforts stem from identifying pre-existing problems when reviewing other contributors' PRs.

I have been maintaining non-package parts of Nixpkgs, such as the Module System (in collaboration with @infinisil), reviewing contributions for `dockerTools` and `lib`, and maintaining the NixOS and Nixpkgs entrypoints. For example, I made the `nixosSystem` `system` parameter optional.

Since being invited onto the Nix team in 2022, I have worked the team to transform Nix (the package manager) from an understaffed bus factor 1 project to a collaboratively maintained project. Examples of contributions are
  - Identifying areas of Flakes that need work before its stability can be committed to sustainably, and work on such fixes in and around `fetchTree`, which is an essential part of Flakes.
  - Fixes to avoid evaluator crashes, and a few long standing "papercuts"
  - Reviews of RFC 92 Dynamic Derivations PRs by John Ericson

#### What I'll do

*Community*

I want the community to thrive. We need to make clear decisions towards inclusivity and move forward. Everyone should feel welcome and accepted here. A tech community is a place to collaborate, find common ground, and - if you wish - make friends.

That said, we must recognize that software is not free from politics. The reality is that people have made people political, and software is a human endeavor.
Being part of this community means accepting other humans for who they are, and acting with mutual respect.

*Ethics*

Sponsorships are not merely donations; they entail benefits such as advertising and imply a form of partnership. Given the global nature of our community, we are committed to ethical sponsorship practices.

Therefore, we will reject sponsorships from entities that engage in harmful activities, including but not limited to military institutions, defense contractors, and companies involved in the production of weapons, surveillance equipment, or mass surveillance software. We will review and update this exclusion list to cover other harmful products and practices, with input from the community.

We do not seek to exclude individuals from participating in the NixOS community based on their employment, except in cases where individuals explicitly promote or advertise their employer in a manner that contradicts our ethical guidelines.

The foundation will accept donations only without stipulation, or if earmarked for pre-existing, approved projects. No new projects will be funded solely by targeted donations unless they align with the foundation's goals and receive prior approval.

To safeguard the integrity and independence of the foundation, we will ensure that neither the foundation nor the community becomes financially dependent on a single company, organization, group, individual, or sector. This principle is critical to maintaining the autonomy and neutrality of the NixOS project.

*Technology*

I've contributed to key areas of the Nix ecosystem, which has given me a good understanding of various aspects of it.

However, I see the role of the Steering Committee as representing the community first and helping the community to clarify its direction, and supporting it.

Therefore I believe it is essential that we source input from the community first, so that we can get a more accurate overview and effectively prioritize and plan.

One of our strengths as a community is the diversity not just of ourselves but in our efforts, which has allowed us to build the largest repository of packages. We should cherish this approach, but also recognize its limits when it comes to other important goals.

With the Steering Committee, I aim to ensure that we are setting priorities based on community feedback and mobilizing external resources, such as funding to support our projects.
