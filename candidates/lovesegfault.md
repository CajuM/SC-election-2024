### Conflict of interest disclosure

I am employed full time by AWS to work on the Rust language.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

I have been a Nix contributor for many years now, and have maintained a number of important packages such as Firefox, Nix, the Linux kernel, and the bootstrap tarballs throughout that time. I was also involved in one of the earliest proposals for organizing the community during the 2021 OceanSprint, which looked remarkably close to the structure we have now. I’ve been a Nix evangelist since ~2018, having introduced numerous friends, coworkers, and employers to it. I believe Nix is a revolutionary technology, and have generally strived to show people how much better it can make their lives as developers, sysadmins, or Linux enthusiasts.

#### What I'll do

My primary goals are to keep the Nix project innovative, forward-looking, and inclusive. I do not want to see us stagnate, and I see two main risks to this:

- The fracturing of the community due to essentially nonexistent leadership and growing frustration
- Tipping too heavily on either side of the delicate balance between breaking things to make them better and keeping things as they are for the sake of stability.

I believe innovation can come from anywhere, and we need to be open to that and not drive people away. Every time someone leaves because they feel unwelcome or unsupported, that is one less candle that might shine brightly and light our path to improving Nix. If we believe in the power of Nix to improve the world, we have a responsibility to avoid that and give us the best possible chance at succeeding in our mission, and I want to ensure we don’t lose sight of that. There is a delicate balance here too, one’s light cannot shine at the cost of another’s, we need everyone to work together if we are to succeed.

Similarly, I believe our community’s fearlessness in innovating is something we cannot risk losing. I do not want to see us become a tool that changes so drastically and so quickly that only the most in-the-know developers can understand how to use it. I also do not want to see us become ossified and stop innovating, even when it comes with some growing pains, mostly in regard to stability. At my day job, I lead a team that’s responsible for the developer experience of thousands of software engineers, and striking this balance is a central part of what I do. I want to bring some of that expertise to our project, and help us set up a framework for how we think and handle these trade-offs.

Finally, I want folks to know that I truly love Nix the technology and the community. It has helped me tremendously in my career, and I would not have my current role without everything I’ve learned here. I’m a better engineer for it, and the friends I’ve made have made me a better person as well. I want to make sure everyone has the opportunity I’ve had, to learn, grow, make friends, and make an impact on users who love using our tools.
