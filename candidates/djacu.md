### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

I have contributed to Nixpkgs, the NixOS homepage, and documentation. I co-founded and co-organize the SoCal Nix Users Group. I co-organized NixCon 2024 in the USA. I gave talks at NixCon 2022 in Paris and NixCon 2024 in the USA.

#### What I'll do

Exactly what is allowed of me based on the Constitution: create new teams if necessary, empower the teams that already exist, collaborate with the board, and guide the direction of the project. To accomplish that I think we need to open channels of communication. With the creation of the SC, various groups and teams now have a team of people they can turn to for help or when difficult decisions need to be made. Whether that be through regular meetings, emails, or other async communication, I want to be there for people that need help and resolution.
