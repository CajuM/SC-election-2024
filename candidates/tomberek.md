### Conflict of interest disclosure

I am employed by Flox (https://flox.dev) as my primary source of income.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I believe that the functional software deployment model is the correct
way for software to be managed and that Nix (or something quite close
to it) is going to be the commonly accepted way to handle the
ever-increasing complexity of software. My goal is to propagate and
promote Nix. This is not something that can be done as an individual,
or by any one company or organization; it will take a community of
diverse interests and therefore my motivation is to help the community
manage the current growth.

#### What I have done

I've been a part of this community for over a decade and participated
in various teams (Marketing, Nix UX, Nix development, RFC Steering
Committee, RFC writing and shepherding) and organizing Nix Meetups and
Conferences. I've held a large number of Office Hours and regularly
focus on helping newcomers and guiding people to become contributors.

#### What I'll do

I plan to help establish project direction and assist the various
teams to accommodate the growing interest in the ecosystem.
Considering the importance of the role, I will work to onboard new
participants into the teams I am on and prioritize Steering Committee
responsibilities.
