None.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

I am running for the Steering Committee because I have a deep love for Nix and its community, and I want to help it reach its full potential. Nix has been an integral part of my life for over a year, and I am fully committed to advancing it both technically and socially. The principles of declarativity, reproducibility, and reliability are what make Nix special compared to everything else today. I believe we can and should expand these to include automation, which will empower Nix to grow even further.

Nix is defined by its community. The passionate users and contributors are the heart of Nix, and that’s why I’m running to represent the community. I want to ensure that the Steering Committee operates with complete transparency, amplifying your voices and ensuring our governance is inclusive, reflecting the values we share.

On the technical side, my focus is on driving Nix forward by fostering innovation while safeguarding the stability that users depend on. My goal is to balance progress with the foundational principles that have made Nix a success, ensuring that it continues to evolve while staying true to its roots.

Additionally, I am deeply committed to advocating for copyleft and free software principles, ensuring that future Nix projects remain open, collaborative, and aligned with our shared vision of a free and open-source ecosystem. By integrating these values into every aspect of Nix’s growth, I believe we can secure its future as a leading force in the open-source world.

#### What I have done

- Played a pivotal role in making the out-of-tree [NixOS COSMIC flake](https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/nixos-cosmic) possible, including packaging COSMIC apps in nixpkgs, establishing the [NixOS COSMIC Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#cosmic:nixos.org), and initiating efforts to [upstream COSMIC to nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/259641).

- Authored multiple [PRs to nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?page=2&q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+author%3Anyabinary) and maintain multiple packages on nixpkgs, contributing to the continuous improvement of the Nix ecosystem.

- Co-authored and currently working on [RFC 0182](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/182).

- Participated in governance discussions across various platforms like [Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/nyanbinary/summary), [Zulip](https://nixpkgs.zulipchat.com/#narrow/sender/715169-Niko-Cantero), and more.

#### What I'll do

As a member of the Steering Committee, I'll advocate for the following:

##### Technical Goals

- Stabilize flakes as v0, then develop next-gen (or “flakesv1”) flakes to address long-standing design issues.
- Make flakes first-class, fully documented features, ensuring flake-related issues aren’t blocked by their experimental status.
- Formalize an official Nix language specification to ensure consistency and clarity in development.
- Advocate for declarative disk management, declarative secret management, and a home management system to enhance system reproducibility.
- Explore integrating flake-parts into nixpkgs as flakes become more stable.
- Advocate for automating nixpkgs to reduce contributor workload, focusing on implementing automated bumps for a curated core set of packages to keep them consistently up-to-date with minimal manual input.
- Improve Nix error messages to make them more intuitive and easier to understand.
- Improve and centralize all Nix-related documentation.
- Lower the barrier to learning and contributing to Nix, making it more accessible to newcomers.
- Reduce reliance on proprietary platforms like Microsoft’s GitHub by transitioning to self-hosted infrastructure where feasible.
- Self-host our own binary cache instead of relying on third-party services.
- Advocate for optimizing Nix to improve speed, reduce resource usage, and enhance efficiency, making common operations faster and more responsive for users.
- Advocate for expanding cross-platform support for Nix, making it easier to use on different operating systems like Windows.

##### Licensing and Ethical Goals

- Encourage stricter copyleft licensing for new Nix projects.
- Implement strong penalties for undisclosed conflicts of interest in decision-making, especially when detrimental to the community or project.
- Establish clear sponsorship and partnership guidelines prioritizing contributors’ wishes over company or board interests, ensuring the board and SC represent the community.
- Support transparency in decision-making by publishing SC voting records, ensuring accountability and clear communication of decisions.
- Ensure the SC operates transparently, keeping the community informed and engaged in all major decisions, and publishing regular transparency reports.
- Advocate for transparent donation and funding processes, ensuring contributors know how funds are allocated and spent.

##### Community-Specific Goals

- Establish regular feedback loops for the SC, allowing the community to provide input on decisions and ongoing initiatives.
- Involve the community in decision-making processes and consistently seek feedback to ensure community voices are being heard.
- Advocate for direct community participation in SC decisions through regular community referendums on major changes, fostering a sense of shared ownership.
- Establish community-driven roadmaps and hold open SC meetings to involve contributors in setting the project’s direction.
- Promote stronger community representation in all governance structures, ensuring that every voice, especially from underrepresented groups, is heard.
- Introduce whistleblower mechanisms to address issues without fear, going beyond anonymous moderation reports.
- Establish more frequent community meetings to openly discuss upcoming SC initiatives and foster direct dialogue between contributors and leadership.
- Advocate for SC member office hours to ensure that contributors can easily reach out and engage with leadership.

I want this list to evolve with input from contributors and the wider Nix community. It's important for me to understand what the community wants from Nix and what the community feels should be prioritized. By regularly engaging with the community, we (the SC as a whole) can ensure the direction of Nix aligns with what the community needs and wants from Nix :).
