### Conflict of Interest Disclosure

I am a part of the Summer of Nix program doing Nix work for NLNet and NGI-nix.
Additionally, I was offered a potential later position doing Nix work by Valentin Gagarin (fricklerhandwerk).

I am a student at Purdue University studying Computer Science, and a member of both the Purdue Linux Users Group and Purdue Hackers.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

I have made a number of contributions to Nixpkgs, both to modules and to packages. Most notably, I helped revitalize the JDK through culling old packages and doing a bump of all extant JDK versions, which has helped make OpenJDK more maintainable.
I am also the creator and maintainer of nix-minecraft, a project for packaging Minecraft server software which also includes a more advanced module for hosting multiple Minecraft servers.
For my personal projects, my NixOS configuration 'universe' has represented over 2200 commits and 3 years worth of my investment into building on and working with NixOS across all of my machines. I also use Nix and NixOS for all of my software projects, and have talked about and helped others with using Nix.
I attended NixCon NA 2024 in March, and it was a great experience meeting many people in the community.

#### What I'll do

Having been a part of the community for a whole now, though I am not as deeply entrenched into the chatrooms, it was very disheartening to see how the community imploded. I want to do my best to prevent further degredation and help the community heal through making the project approachable and easy to be a part of. This comes in 2 forms: Working directly with the community, through things like moderation, and working on improving infrastructure through clear policies for change and through technical solutions like the recently-implemented merge bot.

My desire for change draws on my experience with organizations that have a mix of flat and non-flat hierarchies that try to give large amounts of agency to individuals while also making sure that groups have a consensus on the direction where everything is going. In particular, drawing from being an officer in Purdue Hackers, which has a very flat hierarchy, and being a moderator for a large D&D West Marches server, which has a deeper hierarchy to split up responsibility while still having team-wide votes and feedback on decisions. Ideally, the SC will delegate as much responsibility as possible in order to make a flat project-focus hierarchy, akin to Purdue Hackers, while still having oversight as a 'mentor team' akin to the D&D server.
