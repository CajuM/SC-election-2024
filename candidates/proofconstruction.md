### Conflict of interest disclosure

I'm currently a member of the documentation team, for which my work is and has been on a volunteer basis and unpaid.

I have used Nix at work extensively for several years, as an employee, as an independent contractor, and as a business owner, and I intend to continue doing so.

At a few times in the past, I applied for employment with companies which substantially used Nix, including some which are familiar names in this space. No offer of employment was extended.

I have no conflicts of interest at present, nor have I been party to any in the past.

Table stakes: I commit to avoiding any conflict of interest now and in the future (for example, by forgoing opportunities). Should a conflict of interest arise anyway, I commit to immediate and public disclosure, and further commit to either decisively resolving such conflict in favor of this community (for example, by terminating an existing business relationship) or recusing myself from all relevant obligations and responsibilities to this community.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee
In the praxicracy, everyone is invited to grab a shovel; contributing my time, energy, and skills to this effort is currently the highest-leverage way I can answer that call.

Nix is our best hope for mitigating the complexity-explosion of software packaging and deployment systems - and already does a phenomenal job serving that need - but the project stands at a crossroads: while some would see progress continue along existing lines, with individual interests driving development, others prefer the formation of new structures to organize within and a move to higher-order orchestration; the Steering Committee is the first expression of the latter.

To adequately serve the rest of the NixOS organization and the broader community, the Steering Committee needs clarity of purpose and effective decisionmaking to meet current and future challenges in scaling, funding, and elsewhere. It is my belief that these will be best achieved by a Committee whose members share the following traits, which I know of myself:
    - strong leadership abilities, particularly in public communication, consensus-building, and negotiation
    - a service-mindset, and unwavering dedication to the needs of the community and the broader mission
    - persistence in working towards goals, paired with a willingness to pivot and shift priorities as necessary
    - strategic foresight and accurate appraisal of how current activities lead to intended outcomes
    - familiarity and facility with the theory and practice of functional programming

#### What I have done
Primarily - and in my opinion most importantly - I've tried to address some shortcomings in the documentation. My personal interest here is in advancing the use of Nix and its ecosystem closure as the default computing methodology, bringing practical computation closer to a theoretical ideal and making computers more accessible to everyone. In Nix, as in all my teaching work, I try to accomplish this primarily by
- identifying what things are important to learn,
- evaluating how those things are taught,
- producing materials which teach those things more effectively and efficiently.

Often this looked like showing up to meetings of the Learning Journey Working Group to triage Issues and PRs, discuss narrative strategy, haggle over choice of wording, and so on.

When possible, I've contributed more visibly and substantially, to documentation pieces like the [packaging existing software tutorial](https://nix.dev/tutorials/packaging-existing-software) and the transcription of @infinisil's [module system deep dive](https://nix.dev/tutorials/module-system/deep-dive), or to the occasional message on Matrix, Discourse, and unofficial channels.

Outside of the docs work, I've assisted with the STF grant applications, including [the successful application](https://github.com/nix-community/projects/blob/main/completed/nixpkgs-security.md) to fund the [Nix Security Tracker](https://github.com/Nix-Security-WG/nix-security-tracker) project. While I didn't contribute to the code base during the initial stages, I've lately been devoting a few hours per week to hopefully get it over the finish line.

Like many projects, much progress happens off mailing lists and "behind the scenes", in verbal communication within informal meetings and direct messages. Some in the broader community know me best in this context, doing things like
- building consensus towards the creation of new teams. For example, while the [CUDA team](https://nixos.org/community/teams/cuda/) is doing *incredible* work, their focus is specifically on support for the Nvidia platform, and many agree (e.g. [INRIA](https://nix-tutorial.gitlabpages.inria.fr/nix-tutorial/)) that we sorely need a team focused on bringing Nix to the high-performance computing space in general. (Our friends in the Guix project have an [HPC team](https://hpc.guix.info/) already!),
- lending additional eyes to active development work, often catching things others miss, suggesting useful refactors, or recalling definitions of things I've seen while spelunking in the source code,
- wordsmithing public releases to help ensure the organization is well- and accurately-represented, and
- agitating for better governance! Some of the responsibility for getting us to this election falls on me, after countless hours arguing about [how we ought to allocate our temporal and financial resources.](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixcon-governance-workshop/32705)

#### What I'll do
At this early stage, I can only responsibly commit to my intentions and actions rather than outcomes but here are some things I want to do:

- *Form new commercial and public partnerships*, to push Nix into more places across the software industry, and in turn get more dedicated developer time from those partners.
- *Establish a US-based foundation* as a North American counterpart to the NixOS Stichting, allowing non-European organizations to make financial or other contributions without worrying about the value-added tax.
- *Make Nix truly global*, forging bonds with our currently under-served friends in Africa, Asia, and South America.
- *Allocate the organization's funds to paying more contributors*, in an effort to make more progress faster, to reward the hard work of contributors to the ecosystem, and to bring new developers onboard the project.
- *Continue working to improve the official documentation*, especially for tutorials in the initial learning journey and how-to guides for common use-cases.
- *Support the moderation team*, to improve the level of discourse and keep the Nix community friendly and productive.
