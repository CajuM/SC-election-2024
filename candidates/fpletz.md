### Conflict of interest disclosure

I am currently neither employed by an organization using Nix nor am I
getting paid for work on projects related to Nix.

### Motivation to be on the Steering Committee

#### What I have done

I have been using and contributing to NixOS since 2014. I served as
NixOS Release Manager for 17.09 and 18.03. I was a member of the NixOS
Security Team since its inception in 2017 until 2022. Before 2020, I
have been maintaining quite a lot of nixpkgs components like the nginx
module and its ACME integration, the Gitlab module, some core packages
like systemd and have been doing big migrations like default GCC
version bumps and added the integration of compiler hardening flags.
I've been taking part in organizing local NixOS meetups, some NixCons
and held some talks & workshops promoting NixOS in different settings
and conferences.

I haven't been very active from 2020 until the end of of 2023 and
haven't taken part in the discussions of the recent dramas. The only
exception is that I have signed the open letter "NixOS Users Against
MIC Sponsorship" and still stand by my decision.

#### What I'll do

One of my main gripes with NixOS was the difficulty of reaching
decisions and consensus because we didn't have working processes in
place. Big PRs or PRs that touch core components without the support of
a committer still tend to linger open very a very long time. I believe
the main reason is that most committers are unsure about the amount of
feedback needed to merge such PRs. While the RFC process has improved
this, I think we can improve the situation and reduce the number of
open PRs and lingering draft RFCs. In my opinion, the steering
committee with only a few trusted community members that can reach
decision quickly and has the power to support or cancel initiatives
not fitting our project direction early is good for both contributors
and the community at large.

The main thing I want to solve in my tenure is the cache hosting
problem. I believe that we don't have to hang onto all cache contents
apart from previous stable NixOS releases and self-hosting the cache by
using the resources of multiple sponsors is more cost-effective and
reliable than relying on the services of a single cloud provider. My
goal is to help transform our cache monoculture to a mirror system that
is more comparable to other community-driven operating systems like
Debian.

<summary>What's the best way for the steering committee to deal with inaction or being ignored? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/114">link</a>)</summary>

One of the main ways in which the previous Nix governance has been criticized is for ignoring or being inactive in the face of community protests and concerns.[^1]

[^1]: I'm not interested in rehashing or re-litigating these specific cases or people involved; please do not do so in your answer.

Let's suppose that the steering committee is now responsive to the community... but when the steering committee asks for or directs action, that request is **ignored**, **de-prioritized**, or **litigated** by the relevant parties.

How would you as a single SC member deal with this? How would you ask for your fellow steering committee members to act as a group?

<summary>What is your plan on improving the darwin PR situtation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/97">link</a>)</summary>

Right now ofborg often takes days to complete package builds for the darwin arches and it is unviable as a reviewer to wait for them to complete as they might never complete or just time out, so darwin builds are often with a bit of luck. Also if they fail, people are often clueless on how to fix the compiler/linker issues.

What are your ideas for that? Should darwin be demoted to tier 3? Should we try to find sponsors for new hardware?

<summary>What are your thoughts on adding analytics or crash/error reporting to `nix`? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/122">link</a>)</summary>

Question https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/109 by @iFreilicht brought up this topic, and I thought it was worth discussing on its own, because it is quite a nuanced topic. On one hand it has a lot of privacy implications, on the other hand some specific data might be valuable for improving Nix.

Do you think this could be beneficial?
If so, what data could you imagine being helpful to the project?
Do you think it could be implemented in a way that is broadly supported in the community?

<summary>What are your thoughs about eventually merging core with Guix? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/116">link</a>)</summary>

Guix and Nix have a lot in common. Both have a base dir store (/{gnu,nix}/store), both have those drv files that basically run a command with args and env vars in a restricted environment.

It seems natural, at least for me, that in some way both can have a common project and basically a different stdenv and abstractions over it. Maybe the daemon and store parts could be shared and each project would only have it's own evaluator and nixpkgs and users could use Guix to use the same infrastructure Nix would use to build and remote build stuff.

What are your thoughs about eventually uniting this core in a common project?

<summary>What are your thoughs about bringing Grafts to Nix? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/115">link</a>)</summary>

Grafts are a way from Guix to bring fixes to packages that a lot of other packages depend on without having to rebuild the world basically.

What are your thoughs about bringing a equivalent feature to Nix?

<summary>Actions on ecosystem fragmentation? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/89">link</a>)</summary>

There's a perception that the NixOS ecosystem is becoming increasingly fragmented, whether due to governance disagreements, technical divergences, or experimentation with new approaches.

<summary>How will you help decrease the number of open PRs in Nixpkgs? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/84">link</a>)</summary>

With the whole Wayland-protocols debate going on, one cannot skip the parallel to Nixpkgs. Some users have a good friend committer to have their PRs reviewed and merged. But the frustration even hits some committers that sometimes are caught self-merging.

Practical solutions to end the frustration would (and will) take the entire community participation. How can you, as a lead, help both to accommodate all the opinions and to speed the adoption of solutions, taking down the number while caring about the health (consider burnout) of those involved on applying those measures?

<summary>How can we improve UX? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/109">link</a>)</summary>

We all have opinions on the Nix UX, but I think we can agree that it needs improving. I've noticed that in many discussions, we talk about "the user" and our assumptions for what they would expect or understand, without really knowing.

We have no user journeys, no personas, no analytics about how people are actually using Nix which makes good decisions difficult.

Should we focus more on UX than we currently are? What actions would you take to do so?

<summary>What your thoughs about a NixOS-like thing for clusters? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/117">link</a>)</summary>

A issue I see with NixOS is that NixOS servers treat machines as pets, which is often normal and desired, but limits the potential to use Nix in clusters or grids of machines. Yeah, there are ways like using NixOS as a platform to run some clustering software such as Nomad or Kubernetes but then you lose most of the cool stuff NixOS has. One can still build the stuff that will be run with Nix to OCI containers but would need to manage and define services using some form of YAML, or HCL. Nix already has stuff for incremental copying of artifacts using nix-copy-closure and binary caches but this is lost when you have to build a OCI container each time you iterate in a service to be run.

BTW systemd has already lots of primitives to be used for this. I think the biggest challenge here would be to unify networking between services. 

What are your thoughs, and vision, about this possible line of work?

<details>
<summary>What are your thoughs about integrating distributed stores into Nix? (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/113">link</a>)</summary>

AFAIK the most well known implementation is ipfs-nix from Obsidian systems that aim to integrate IPFS into Nix.

I, at least in the current state, am a bit skeptical about how the adoption would be. A full bump of my system would pull 10s of GBs of small artifacts, and if you have ever downloaded the closure of LaTeX packages you realized that lots of small operations == slow. I tried myself to make a RFC around exposing IPFS-compatible hashes in a narinfo so users could alternatively use IPFS to download stuff from binary caches but I basically abandoned the idea because I, myself, didn't think it would make much sense. The process would be so slow + the overhead of having to have stuff both in the nix store and IPFS store. I would only use something like this if I wouldn't need to duplicate stuff.

<summary>Financial support for maintainers (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/SC-election-2024/issues/108">link</a>)</summary>

Many (though not all) contributors to and maintainers of the nix ecosystem are doing so as unpaid volunteer work next to their fulltime jobs. This is not sustainable, we either need more maintainers, or we need to lower the workload of the ones we have.

One way of doing this would be to sponsor them so they can switch to part-time positions or outright quit their jobs and work on Nix or nixpkgs full-time, potentially with money the foundation already receives in donations.

Would you be in favor of doing something like this? Why or why not?

Currently, we seem to be promising compatibility for stable branches, but in new releases, we are allowed to break "if necessary". Where do you think the line of "if necessary" should fall?

How close do you think we can with long-term backwards compatibility - to the Clojure ideal [1] - given the scale of nixpkgs?

Can you answer specifically about NixOS module options, as well as generally for nix community projects?
