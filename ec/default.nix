        Hello, @@GITHUB_LOGIN@

        As a first step towards a better governance for official Nix projects,
        we are happy to announce the kick-off of the [first Nix Steering Committee election][repo]!

        [repo]: ${repo}

        The Steering Committee will be the primary community leadership body, responsible for steering the official Nix projects --
        organisationally, socially, and technically.
        This includes making decisions over what is official, managing teams,
        approving NixOS Foundation policies relevant for the community,
        being the final escalation point, and more as [detailed in the Nix Governance Constitution][constitution].

        [constitution]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix-constitutional-assembly/blob/main/constitution.md#steering-committee

        While the Steering Committee is given the authority to make decisions within the scope of its responsibilities directly,
        it is expected to delegate as much as possible.
