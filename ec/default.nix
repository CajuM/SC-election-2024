          Hello, @@GITHUB_LOGIN@

        + ''
          As a first step towards a better governance for official Nix projects,
          we are happy to announce the kick-off of the [first Nix Steering Committee election][repo]!

          [repo]: ${repo}

          The Steering Committee will be the primary community leadership body, responsible for steering the official Nix projects --
          organisationally, socially, and technically.
          This includes making decisions over what is official, managing teams,
          approving NixOS Foundation policies relevant for the community,
          being the final escalation point, and more as [detailed in the Nix Governance Constitution][constitution].

          [constitution]: https://github.com/NixOS/nix-constitutional-assembly/blob/main/constitution.md#steering-committee

          While the Steering Committee is given the authority to make decisions within the scope of its responsibilities directly,
          it is expected to delegate as much as possible.
